                    <h2>Hitman</h2>
                    <p>Legendary assassin Agent 47 is back to take out one of his most exciting sets of targets yet. This series reboot finds 47 exploring an intense set of international locations as he works to eliminate a variety of targets he&#8217;s assigned. It&#8217;s easily the most creative Hitman game, with multiple ways to carry out assassinations, including explosives, accidental deaths, or a well-timed shot from a silenced pistol. It&#8217;s up to you to figure out how you want to approach each kill, and that&#8217;s the beauty of this new vision of Hitman. Whether you&#8217;re new to the series or have been following each installment, you&#8217;ll be thrilled with how each mission plays out.</p>
