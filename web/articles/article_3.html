                    <h2>God of War</h2>
                    <p>Few stories in video gaming are as poignant as the journey of Kratos and his son Atreus through Midgard and beyond. Trading the Greek Pantheon for Norse mythology was exactly what the franchise needed to propel it forward narratively. Smooth combat is perfectly counterbalanced with scenes with Kratos struggling to fulfill his wife&#8217;s last wish to have her ashes scattered from the highest peak in all the Norse realms while Atreus deals with the loss of his mother. Great gameplay and an excellent story make God of War one of the best PS4 exclusives yet.</p>
