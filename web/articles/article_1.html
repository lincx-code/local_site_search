                    <h2>Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Ages</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes a game doesn&#8217;t have to be particularly innovative to be good. Dragon Quest XI doesn&#8217;t have any new tricks up its sleeve. Instead, it refines the JRPG formula to its best components and pulls them off wonderfully. The turn-based combat and mysterious hero story feel delightfully retro, but there&#8217;s enough modern convenience packed in to make it still feel fresh. In a time when long-running franchises are trying (sometimes too hard) to stay relevant, Dragon Quest XI is fine with being reliable and well-built, which ironically makes it unique among its peers.</p>
