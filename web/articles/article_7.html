                    <h2>Monster Hunter: World</h2>
                    <p>Capcom struck gold with more than just the Resident Evil series this gen. Monster Hunter: World is just the latest main game in the 20-plus-year-old franchise, but it&#8217;s the one that took the series from niche to mainstream. The intense hunting and fighting mechanics are only made more fun by the fact you can bring up to three friends along with you. The deep RPG mechanics and co-op gameplay make for a unique experience and you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to tear yourself away as you prepare for just one more hunt.</p>
