                    <h2>Fallout 4</h2>
                    <p>Who would have thought the post-apocalypse could be so fun? Fallout 4 puts you in the shoes of someone who awakens from cryogenic sleep 100 years after a nuclear war wipes out most of civilization. What you do after that is up to you. There are dozens of stories throughout the Boston wasteland and you can choose to prey on the poor souls trying to live in this harsh world or you can build new communities and stave off the wilderness. You can spend hundreds of hours with this game and still find new things to see and do, and few titles give you this much bang for your buck.</p>
