                    <h2>Persona 5</h2>
                    <p>The Persona series has always been known for its slick presentation, effortlessly cool vibe, and killer soundtrack. And that&#8217;s all without even mentioning the gripping story and memorable cast. Persona 5 follows the students of the fictional Shujin Academy as they navigate double lives as student who become the altruistic &#8220;Phantom Thieves&#8221; by night, doing their part to rid the world of individuals with corrupt &#8220;mind palaces,&#8221; or the bad actors who take on villainous personas of their own in the real world.</p>
                    <p>Offering a combination of dungeon exploration with turn-based battles that work in tandem with visual novel and dating-sim like elements, it makes for one of the wildest, most gripping experiences PlayStation 4 has to offer&#8212;and this is only the fifth main entry in the Persona series. Just imagine where it could go from here.</p>
