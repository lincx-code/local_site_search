                    <h2>Horizon Zero Dawn</h2>
                    <p>Developer Guerrilla Games, responsible for the gleefully violent Killzone series, tried something massively different with the introduction of Horizon Zero Dawn, and it worked out swimmingly for them. A strong-willed female protagonist named Aloy must explore a vibrant yet mysterious world rife with mechanical creatures from the olden days. Armed with knowledge of her past, Aloy must work with the tribes scattered around the land to save her future&#8212;and possibly the world. With advanced, realistic animation and motion capture effects, Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the most gorgeous games the system has to offer, and you&#8217;ll find yourself exploring the plain of this strange new world for hours on end.</p>
